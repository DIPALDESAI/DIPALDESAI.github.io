Alerts "fail". Read [why this works](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4170978/explain-why-this-works?lq=1). Another similar [StackOverflow topic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7202157/can-you-explain-why-10).

{% highlight js %}
alert((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]);
{% endhighlight %}
