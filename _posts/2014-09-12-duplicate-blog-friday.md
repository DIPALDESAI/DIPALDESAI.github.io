Morning started rather interesting. I was googling search terms related to my blog and was quite surprised when I found another blog with the same content and design as this one. The domain was a regular .com and it had a bit different style, but overall it was a complete copy of this one.

Owner's email was easy to find in whois, and I contacted him to find out what is happening. Turns out that the guy was trying to use the theme and had forked the whole [GitHub repo of the blog](https://github.com/lauris/lauris.github.com) instead. He apologized and removed my content from his site. I am fine with someone using the theme, because [this blog is completely open source](https://github.com/lauris/lauris.github.com) and available to anyone. Content on the other hand is not. I had planned to release the theme one day and now I am probably going to do that pretty soon. Just need to clean things up a bit and think of a name.
