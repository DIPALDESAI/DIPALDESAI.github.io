Few weeks ago [we](http://datazenit.com/) got accepted into [Microsoft BizSpark](http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/default.aspx). It is a program that gives away Microsoft <span title="Visual Studio, Office, Windows 8, SQL Server, Visio, Windows Server and more." style="border-bottom:1px dotted #ccc;">products</span> to startups. Besides all the free software and startup community, they also provide us with â‚¬115/month credit for Azure services. **For 3 years.** The credit is enough to spin up several virtual server instances, SQL Server and a lot more. Check out the [pricing calculator](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) to get a general idea. So far I haven't seen a catch, and if everything proves to be alright, we will move at least some of our cloud services to Azure. I have already set up an environment for testing and CI, and it seems to be working like a charm.

P.S. This post was initially a tweet, but I had a trouble to express myself in 140 chars.
