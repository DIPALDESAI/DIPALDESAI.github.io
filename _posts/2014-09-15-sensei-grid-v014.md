This is the 5th release of Sensei Grid, a simple data grid in JS/HTML. The biggest addition in this release is new row support and handling. This is implemented as an empty row at the end of table. The empty row can be enabled/disabled via configuration setting: ``emptyRow: false``. By default the functionality is enabled.
