Today I was pleasantly surprised when [Sensei Grid](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid), an open source project I am currently working on, reached the front page of the Hacker News. It resulted in interesting [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8280826), huge load of traffic and new followers on Github. The Github repository if currently 3rd in [the Trending repo list](https://github.com/trending). 

Whatever. I think that people somehow underestimated one of the most important aspects of Sensei Grid - the fact that it is backed by a company that uses Sensei Grid in a commercial product. It means that the open source library is getting dedicated full-time development and maintenance, and won't just disappear one day. 

It was also interesting to see how popularity of Sensei Grid transformed into new beta signups for [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com). I suppose that people are interested in a real-world product where Sensei Grid is used.
