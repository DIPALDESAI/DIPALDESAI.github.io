Today I was pleasantly surprised when [Sensei Grid](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid), an open source project I am currently working on, reached the top of Hacker News' front page and stayed there for several hours. It resulted in an interesting [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8280826), huge load of traffic and new followers on Github. The Github repository if currently 3rd in [the Trending repo list](https://github.com/trending).

From the discussion I got an insight that there is some room for a new open source data grid and at least few other people shared the same pain I had when trying to find a decent data grid solution. 

It was also interesting to see how popularity of Sensei Grid transformed into new beta signups for [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com). I suppose that people are interested in a real-world product where Sensei Grid is used.

**Update:** Sensei Grid was featured in two daily emails from GitHub as a Trending project. The community has grown quite a bit and the development has just started to gain momentum.
