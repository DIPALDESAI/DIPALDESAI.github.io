It has been a long time since my last blog post here. To be more precise it has been 72 days without a blog post.
That's a huge gap considering that previously I published a blog post every day. Finally the Christmas time has come and I got time to reflect on the past two months and all the things that has happened.

During this time I got caught up with an unexpected client work through my web development company [Hedgehog Solutions](http://hedgehogs.lv/).
I had stopped all regular development work for clients since I started building [Datazenit](https://datazenit.com),
but this was an interesting opportunity that was too hard to resist. I probably won't talk about the details here anytime soon, but this got me thinking
about what are things that matter to my company and myself. In a way it was refreshing to do something else for a while, but Datazenit was still
bugging me in the back of my head and I felt sad that I have so little time to spend on it. Now I am trying to reduce the amount of time spent on client work and re-focus back on Datazenit. We are already planning next batches of beta invites in the beginning of January, but there are some things that needs to be fixed before that.

[Sensei Grid](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid) is going strong and is still our most popular open source project. I had a chance to fix some minor bugs recently and fine-tune [the demo page](https://datazenit.com/static/sensei-grid/examples/). Sensei Grid is an integral part of Datazenit and the development will continue as expected. Our initial attempts at open source were successful and worthwhile, and we are planning to release more open source projects next year. Who knows, maybe at some point Datazenit will be fully open source.

There are some changes planned for Hedgehog Solutions around February next year. We have decided to finally design and develop a website for the company itself, because currently we are the shoemaker whose children go barefoot. We never advertised our design and web development services because it wasn't our main focus anyway, but this could change soon. I am actively trying to get more resources onboard so I don't have to jump between all our projects and could focus more on Datazenit.

Ok, enough rambling today.

*Have a satisfactory time during the holidays and don't burn any Christmas trees.*
