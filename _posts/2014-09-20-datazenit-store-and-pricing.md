Today I made some small changes to the [homepage of Datazenit](http://datazenit.com). Most importantly [pricing information](http://datazenit.com/pricing) is now available publicly, also [store](http://datazenit.com/store/login) is fully operational. Keep in mind that Datazenit has not yet been released, and you won't be able to download it right now. However you can place a pre-order in the store to receive Datazenit first on the release day. I can't yet set any specific dates for release day, but I am aiming to launch the product before the end of this year. Beta test will start earlier, and I will notify beta users personally. If you are interested in participating in the beta testing, sign up to the [Beta List](http://datazenit.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=761f26cca592fe1c3544bd29e&id=8255d6bcc1).

PayPal has been chosen as our payment processor, mostly for customer convenience and safety. An important thing to note is that Datazenit store can be used without a PayPal account, because PayPal allows a guest checkout where you enter your credit card information manually and skip PayPal login altogether.

A few small fixes were also made, mostly to the landing page layout and its responsiveness. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please leave a comment or contact me directly via <a href="mailto:lauris@discuss.lv">email</a>.
