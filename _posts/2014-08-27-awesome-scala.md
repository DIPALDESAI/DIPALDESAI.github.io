Scala is awesome, there is even a proof for that â€“ **[awesome-scala](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala)**. 2 months ago I started a list of great Scala libraries, frameworks and tools. The list has significantly grown and improved, thanks to its many contributors. Yesterday the GitHub repository of awesome-scala reached a small milestone: 1000 stars on its GitHub repository. There are also more than 100 forks and 100 watchers, 153 commits, 38 contributors and 64 closed pull requests.

The most intense [debate](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala/pull/19) was about the controversial Scala framework [Lift](http://liftweb.net) and whether it can be called awesome. People had different views, but it was an interesting conversation and I can understand the points of both camps. In the end the framework was added back to the list.

If you are interested in Scala, check out [the list](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala) to get a load of useful libraries and frameworks. There is something for everyone: from databases to reactive programming to big data. 

Speaking of Scala, [Typesafe](https://typesafe.com/), the company behind Scala, Akka and Play framework, has just released an interesting case study. What's it about? Let's find out in the blog post.
