In previous articles ([#1](http://lauris.github.io/datazenit/2014/08/29/open-source-work-2-sensei-grid/), [#2](http://lauris.github.io/development/2014/08/25/work-and-open-source/)) I have mentioned and showcased a small [demo](http://datazenit.com/static/sensei-grid/examples/) of an open source library I am currently working on - Sensei Grid, a simple data grid in JavaScript. Today I cleaned and re-structurized the project, refactored some core classes and published it on GitHub. It is still under active development, but I have a clear plan and goals for the project because it is an essential part of my startup â€“ [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com). Check out **[Sensei Grid at GitHub](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid)**.

## Initial goals for Sensei Grid

* Simplicity: Sensei Grid will be a single purpose data grid without unrelated functionality. 
* Small code base: I will try to avoid bloatware and dirty workarounds/hacks as much as possible to keep the code base small and tidy.
* Extensibility: Even though Sensei Grid will be kept simple, it will be simple to add additional functionality by extending the core grid and editor. 
* Constant development and maintenance: As I previously wrote my belief is that active maintenance is a very important aspect of an open source project. Sensei Grid is part of Datazenit and that means it will be constantly developed and used. 

I will post development progress and updates in this blog and [my twitter account](http://twitter.com/lauriswat).
