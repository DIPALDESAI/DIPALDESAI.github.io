title: Weekly round-up (#6/2014)
---
This week was full of surprises! Hiburo got interviewed by [ArcticStartup](http://arcticstartup.com/). Unusually high amount of subscribers joined [Datazenit Beta List](http://datazenit.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=761f26cca592fe1c3544bd29e&id=8255d6bcc1). We also decided to offer a standalone version of Datazenit (in addition to cloud based version). It means that users will be able to use it locally or on their own servers – more on this in an upcoming blog article. Also all of Datazenit t-shirts ended – they went to early adopters and friends. If you missed a chance to get one, there will be a new batch of t-shirts at the end of beta period.
