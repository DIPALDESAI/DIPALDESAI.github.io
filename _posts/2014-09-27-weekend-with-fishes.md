This weekend together with a few friends I am going to [Sabile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabile), a small Gypsy town in [Courland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courland), [Latvia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia). This is going to be a fishing trip, so most of the time will be spent on a small river called [Abava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abava_River). We were there once, during the summer, and the place was quite enjoyable. Hopefully a few fishes will be our Saturday night special.

I will post a status update tomorrow evening when I am back from the trip.
