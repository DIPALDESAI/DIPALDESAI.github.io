title: The New Logo & Design
---
Once in a while I like to tear things apart and start fresh â€“ this blog is no exception. Thanks again to [Sasha](http://interruptingcow.lv/) for helping with the new logo. For me the Greek letter lambda "&#955;" creates associations with [Lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), [functional programming](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_programming) and of course Half-Life. The letter in logo also makes sense because my first name starts with "L".
