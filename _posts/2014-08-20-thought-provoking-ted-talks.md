I am really a fan of TED talks, I watch them for entertainment, to learn something new and when I am bored. Their slogan basically says it all "Ideas Worth Spreading". There are over 1700 TED talks recorded, but I want to present a list of my all-time favorites.

<!-- more -->

* ["How great leaders inspire action"](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) by Simon Sinek. An exceelent talk about leadership and its true meaning. I highly suggest watching all of his talks.
* ["The best stats you've ever seen"](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) by Hans Rosling. This is even more fun than watching sports. A saturated and vibrant talk about statistics.
* ["How schools kill creativity"](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity) by Ken Robinson. One of the most popular TED talks out there, this is truly a must see for anyone.  
* ["My stroke of insight"](http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight) by Jill Bolte Taylor. Where else could you get an insight of a person experiencing a stroke? And she is not a random person but also a neuroanatomist which makes her insights even more interesting.
* ["Life lessons from an ad man"](http://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man) by Rory Sutherland. Great delivery and an overall interesting talk. Some of his ideas are a bit crazy but entertaining nonetheless.
* ["The transformative power of classical music"](http://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion) by Benjamin Zander. Nobody is tone deaf. It doesn't matter whether you like classical music or not, this talk is for everyone.
