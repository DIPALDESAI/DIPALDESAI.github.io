Today was one of those days off when you just do something random without much thinking. So I just went on a long hike with my girlfriend. We went from our home in Ādaži to the nearest beach (in Carnikava). The route was approx. 23km long and we spent around 5 hours just walking.

I will leave this post short because I currently feel no inspiration to write more. Probably will add more text and pictures to this post tomorrow.
