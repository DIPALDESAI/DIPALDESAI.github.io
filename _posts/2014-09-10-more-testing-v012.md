title: "More testing [v0.1.2]"
category: development

Today was mostly spent on further testing [Sensei Grid](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid). This wasn't a great day for productivity, because a lot of time was wasted on event binding bugs in Jasmine testing environment (reason: curve_hands.dll). All problems were resolved and testing has been going forward pretty smoothly. I plan to finalize tests tomorrow and start working on new functionality on Friday. First thing in the list - implement functionality for adding new rows. 

Overview of development:

* Add dist files for v0.1.2
* Fix: replace e.keyCode with e.which for convenience.
* Add tests for arrow movement.
* Add dom event tests for outside-of-grid clicks.
* Add dom events tests.
* Rename sensei grid wrapper and destroy grid after tests in apiSpec.
* Add destroy method and default font styles to dist assets.
* Fix domSpec: destroy editor in afterEach hook and rename wrapper element to
* Add default font to sensei-grid and editors.
* Add destroy and unbind methods to grid.
* Add new row support to roadmap.

Btw this overview is generated by a handy git command: ``git log --pretty=format:"* %s" v0.1.1..v0.1.2`` where v0.1.* are release tags.
