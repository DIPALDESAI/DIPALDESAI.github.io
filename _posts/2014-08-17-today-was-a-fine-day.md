August 17, a fine Sunday here in Latvia. Not too hot and not too cold, just a perfect, sunny afternoon. Today was annual [Riga City Festival](http://www.rigassvetki.lv/2014/), which attracts a variety of people. Together with my girlfriend we walked around the city centre and enjoyed the ambience of bright mooded people everywhere. There were a lot of activities for kinds and parents, like straw toy workshop, puppet theater and roller blading championship, but there were also several sport related events like a basketball tournament where teams are formed with people from specific crafts and occupations like artists, actors and politicians. Sadly we didn't get out of the house early enough to check out all the activities, but on the other hand it was short enough so I didn't get bored, which is probably good.

Later in the evening I went for small fishing trip outside of the city with few friends. We didn't catch much this time, but it was meant to be a recreational event just for fun. Lakes and rivers have always relaxed me and I can't pass on it. To properly finish the day, we grabbed some junk food from McDonalds and ate it with a great smile. It is really a liberal food, because who can turn it down?

This was also one of the rare days when I didn't do anything work related. Didn't even think about it that much. I will call it a progress.
