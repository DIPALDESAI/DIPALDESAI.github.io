[GetSSL.me](https://getssl.me/) is a side-project of mine that I started in early 2013, but I haven't done any marketing or paid attention to sales for quite some time now, because I am working full-time on [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com). Today I crunched some numbers for September and got pleasantly surprised when I found out that this has been the top month in sales and revenue.

Evidently the project is self-sufficient and runs on it own. Occasionally I need to reply to a support ticket or a call, but that's about it. Thanks to all the loyal customers for sticking around and recommending the service to others. A huge part of the sales are from repeat customers and their friends. I am always as helpful and nice as possbile to all customers, and it seems that most of them value that. Useful customer support (together with reasonable prices) was one of the selling points when the project was first launched.
