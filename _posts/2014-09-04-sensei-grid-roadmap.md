I am currently working on [**Sensei Grid**, a data grid in JavaScript](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid). Every meaningful project, especially an open source one, needs a roadmap and clear goals. In a previous [blog post about Sensei Grid](http://lauris.github.io/development/2014/09/03/first-public-release-sensei-grid/) I wrote about the goals, now I will share a small roadmap for upcoming releases.

<!-- more -->

* Tests and full coverage
* Event callbacks (e.g., save, load, render, move, sort) for an easy extensibility
* Field types (e.g., string, int, date, float)
* Example editor for specific field types (a simple datepicker for date field and similar examples)
* Optional column definition (if the structure of data is simple, assume default column settings)
* Firefox compatibility issues (there are currently some issues with table rendering in Firefox)
* Configuration parameters for grid
* Column sorting (not sure about this just yet)

You can follow the development of [Sensei Grid at GitHub](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid) or check out a demo - [Sensei Grid demo](http://datazenit.com/static/sensei-grid/examples/). The library is part of Datazenit open source initiative.
