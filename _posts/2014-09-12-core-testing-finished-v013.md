This is another status update for [Sensei Grid](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid), an open source project I am working on. As [planned yesterday](http://lauris.github.io/development/2014/09/10/more-testing-v012/), today tests were finished for most important parts of Sensei Grid, and I published a new release - [v0.1.3](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid/releases/tag/v0.1.3). Today went without any hiccups and I was able to finish testing earlier than expected. Because of that I already started working on functionality regarding new row support - there will an empty row at the end of grid and it will be used for adding new rows. It seems to be fairly common and obvious practice. 

Overview of development:

* Bump version to v0.1.3.
* Move row rendering into a separate method renderRow.
* Fix backspace shortcut test.
* Add tests for cell and editor shortcuts.
