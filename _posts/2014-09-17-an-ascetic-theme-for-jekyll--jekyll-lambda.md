Earlier I wrote that someday I will release the theme of this blog as a separate project for anyone to use. Well, that day is today. 

<!-- more -->

The theme is for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a pretty great and minimalistic static site generator. To use it, fork and clone this repository - [jekyll-lambda](https://github.com/lauris/jekyll-lambda). You can find further installation instructions in the [README.md file](https://github.com/lauris/jekyll-lambda/blob/master/README.md).
