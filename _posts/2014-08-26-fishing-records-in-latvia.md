Fishing is one of my biggest hobbies and I try to get near freshwaters as often as I can. Latvia is full of amazing lakes and rivers that are scattered with anglers trying to get that big catch. I noticed that there is no information in English about fishing records in Latvia, so I made a small list. This list doesn't feature all records, just those that seemed interesting to me.

## Pike – 19.56KG

This is one of the longest standing records in Latvia. The fish was caught in 1989 by V. Petjukevičs. I couldn't find a picture of the record online, but I remember seeing it in an old fishing book. If I ever find that book, I will add the photo here.

This record is also special because rarely anyone gets near the old one. 10-15KG pikes are counted as really big ones here.

## Catfish – 84.70KG

The Catfish record was broken by M. Velde in year 2010 in one of the two Catfish occupied rivers in Latvia – [Daugava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daugava_River). Green soft plastic bait was used as the lure. Let the picture speak for itself.

## Zander – 11.80KG

The record size Zander (they are also called pike-perch) was also caught in river Daugava. The previous record was beaten by just 50 grams.

## Ide – 5.50KG

This is probably a lesser known fish, but the biggest Ide caught in Latvia is also the world record of all Ides. It was caught in [lake Lubāns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lub%C4%81ns) in 1989. The lake is currently listed a nature reserve and is also the biggest lake in Latvia. 

## Tench – 3.20KG

First record in this list that was set by a woman. The record was set in 2009 and is also the only record from a pond. Is that even fair?

## Summary

Daugava river is a sweet spot for anglers and it currently holds 4 fishing records. I am lucky enough to be living near several lakes and river Gauja, also one of the longest rivers in Latvia. I prefer going after pikes when I am in an active mood, but when my goal is to relax and enjoy the nature I choose a small lake in nearby forest that is full of Tenches and some smaller fishes. Picture of the lake below.
