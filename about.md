I am a software developer who enjoys exploring new technologies and programming languages. I have developed various projects in languages like Scala, Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript and many more. I am also a co-founder at [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com), a startup building web based database management tool. Datazenit is where I spend most of my time, but I also enjoy going on a trip with my [bike](http://2014.merida-bikes.com/en_int/bikes/cross/cross/2014/crossway-100-381.html), fishing after a long day's work or just building stuff for fun.
