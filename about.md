I am **Lauris Dziļums**, a software developer who enjoys exploring
new technologies and programming languages. I have developed various
projects in Scala, Python, PHP, JavaScript and
many more. I am also co-founder at [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com),
a startup building web-based database administration tool for MySQL and PostgreSQL. Datazenit is where
I spend most of my time, but I also enjoy going on a trip with my bike,
fishing after a long day's work or just building stuff for fun.

Startups and projects:

* [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com) – MySQL and PostgreSQL GUI
* [Hiburo](https://hiburo.com) – lightweight team management web app
* [GetSSL.me](https://getssl.me) – reasonably priced SSL certificate store
* [Sensei Grid](https://github.com/datazenit/sensei-grid) – open source data grid in JS/HTML
* [Awesome Scala](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala) –  list of useful Scala libraries
